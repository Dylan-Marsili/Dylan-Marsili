Hi, I'm Dylan! Self-taught web development and python student, based in Argentina.

I started learning web development on my own in 2022 and I love it! I consider myself a very responsible person with my work, I constantly study and improve my skills to complement all my projects and I enjoy doing it!

The feeling of knowing that it can be done better, of other people's incredible projects that they create, is what constantly motivates me to keep improving to reach and exceed them.
